# Food Explorer


Project for a fictitious restaurant, where there are two personas, the admin and the user.

The admin can create, view, edit, and delete a dish at any time. Each dish contains an image, a name, a category, a brief description, the ingredients, and its price.

The user can view all registered dishes, search for dishes by their name or by the ingredients of the dish and when they click on a dish, they will be redirected to a new screen with more detailed information about it.
